Some smaller fixes.

1.8.2
New command for operator+: /legal - sends a global messsage that the last ones are legal, with a very nice formatted text.
The Blockglitchdetection has been improved. Before it only sent 1 warning per life time when someone glitched to prevent spam. Now it pauses the detection for 5sec when someone glitched, and then sends again.

1.8.0b
It shouldnt spam a message anymore if someone is block glitching.

1.8.0
We added the time left for the last player.
We made the code better visible and created new function, but that should not bother you as a normal player.

1.7.6
We removed the kick for respawn since it triggered too many errors when the server is laggy. Also some functions became unusable but instead we did another system.
If a player respawns and is inside a block a warning to him will be sent and operators that are online will be informed.

1.7.5c
Fixed a bug where /aka kicked you out of the game.

1.7.5b
Decreased the respawn kick sensitivity.
Fixed kill messages.

1.7.5
We added a badword filter so bad words now get cencored.
We added a respawn kick. After hitting the respawn button in 1 round for 3-4 times it kicks you with the message that respawning is forbitten. We do need this to prevent people to block glitch and we know its bad cause you accidantely hit respawn sometimes. The respawn counter is reset after each round has ended and is active. Respawnkick is active from the time that the counter tells 30 until the time that zombies or human won.
We added new kill messages

1.7.4
This does not effect a single player rank etc but the whole server.
Until yet all players ever logged in had their own .txt file for their login message which was pretty unnecessary in my opinion, because it was mostly default "joined the server". I changed it so only those who edited their loginmessage with /buy loginmsg are saved to a .txt files. So we now decreased the loginfiles from about 30k to about 50. This may improve the server performance a bit.
The same thing also happened for every logout message of corse.

1.7.3
We added a anti-team-spleef protection, meaning that zombies can now only spleef humans and not zombies and humans can only spleef zombies and not humans.

1.7.2
We fixed /afk which made it possible for people to influence map votings.
We automatically added the voice status to every trusted+ that logs in.
We fixed /baninfo, which had problems with some capital letters.
We fixed a bug where /t or /ztime sometimes displayed over 60 minutes.

1.7.1
We added a new colorsystem to the server which makes it easy to see whos zombie or not, but server staff will be still easy to recognize.

1.7.0

 /team kick <playername>
 /team join
 /team decline
 /team list
 /team leave
 /team members <teamname>
 /team del

Note that /team create costs 300 cookies.
Some other small bugfixes and improvements:
When using /aka now it tells you what you have toggeled on or off for example: Aka is now ON/OFF.

1.6.5
We edited the permission of adminium back, because it has more disadvantages than advantages.

1.6.4
We changed the permission of adminium. This means operator+ ranks can now use adminium/bedrock when they turn referee mode on and even break the blocks.

1.6.3
We added the command /buy to the /help player command.
We changed the price of rankup from 300 cookies down to 250 cookies meaning to get highest buyable rank will now consume 750 cookies instead of 6

1.6.2
We fixed a bug where /afk doesnt work as it is supposed to be.
We fixed some colors that gone wrong with new map vote.

1.6.1
The levels in mapvoting now have colors.
/fly works now on every level.

1.6.0
We changed the price of blocks to 0.1 per block. Blocks can only be bought in stacks of 10 pieces. So if you type /buy blocks 2 it will give you 20 blocks for a price of 2 cookies.
We changed /wom so it will automatically send a message to all online ops, that you warned someone that is using wom (only effects lowop+)
We changed /tempban so there could now be a reason why a person is tempbanned. For example: /tempban void_public 3 @2 (@2 means rule:2, reason can also be entered mannually)
We also added rule 7 which is do not use glitches to /kick, /warn and /tempban.
We fixed a bug where /infect did not find the person.

1.5.2
/wom <playername> - new command to freeze and warm wom users.
Break between the levels have been increased to 20 sec.
Some code optimization, edited /buy.
We added new sayings when people get eaten (around 4)

1.5.1
We have redone the /help command. So if you use /help <yourrank> you will see the commands available for that rank.
We changed the list of the online players of /who so it appears clearer.
We changed the design a bit
We added a short break (10 seconds) where people can type /g <newlvl> by themselves, we hope to decrease lag with that. People that dont type that will be transfered as usual.
We added 2 new messages when people get eaten.

1.5.0
Fixed a bug when someone logs in and a player is in /referee mode that he can be seen.
Fixed a bug when someone logs in that he sees real names like if he had /aka on.

1.4.1
Fixed /queue zombie <playername>

1.4.0
The command /aka has been fixed and is available for every player now to see zombies realnames.
Some other small bugs have been fixed.

1.3.6
We also fixed a bug when zombies win and 2 players got the same amount of highest kill that only 1 was displayed.

1.3.5
Referees can only teleport now, when they are referee.
If a referee uses /ref to play again, while a zombie game is in process, he will be forced to the spawn.
When zombies win, the zombie with the highest kills is announced.

1.3.4b
Now you can /eat. This will make you loose 1 cookie and a random funny message.
Example: <playername> just ate a cookie.

1.3.4
/money can be used on players that are offline, but still only if they got a less rank.
We also decreased the amount of cookies you get with infect combos. So you only get 2 times the amount of infect combo you got, because we thought it was really imbalanced. Players that had 3 combo kills got more money than those, that survive. So we balanced it so players that do 5 combo kills (which is not that easy) get 10 cookies.

1.3.3
Changed shortcut from /ztime (/left) to /t
Fixed and redone /whowas
Added top players command. Use with /top
As usual some minor bug fixes

1.3.1
